                <p>"Nelson Mandela endured great personal hardship so that others could be provided with dignity,
                    equality and opportunity. He fought discrimination and inhuman exclusion, but rose above bitter
                    divisions to heal and reconcile a fractured nation. His life and work made him a citizen of the
